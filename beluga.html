      <p>Beluga whales are a species of cetaceans, living primarily in the Arctic Ocean and nearby seas in the Northern
        Hemisphere. They're very friendly and social creatures, moving in groups ranging from a few individuals to
        several hundred whales. Their most distinctive characteristic is their large, flexible forehead, also known as a
        'melon,' which is responsible for producing vocalizations for echolocation.</p>
