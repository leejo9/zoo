      <p>White tigers are a rare color variant of the Bengal tiger, characterized by their striking white fur with black or dark brown stripes. This coloration is due to a genetic mutation called leucism. White tigers are not a separate species but are often bred in captivity for their unique appearance, although they face challenges such as higher susceptibility to health issues. Its eyes are often a piercing blue or green, a colour combination that makes them visually striking.</p>
