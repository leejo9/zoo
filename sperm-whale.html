      <p>Sperm whales, famously known from Herman Melville's 'Moby Dick,' are the largest toothed whales and have the largest brain of any animal. They are deep divers, capable of reaching depths of up to 3,000 meters to hunt for squid. Recognized by their large, block-shaped heads and narrow lower jaws, sperm whales are found in oceans worldwide and are known for their complex social structures and vocalizations.</p>
