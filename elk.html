      <p>Elk, also known as wapiti, are large members of the deer family native to North America and parts of Asia. They have strong antlers and are known for their distinctive bugling call, especially during mating season. Elk live in forests and grasslands, feeding on grasses, plants, and bark. Elk also live in large herds that can be made up of hundreds or thousands of elk.</p>
